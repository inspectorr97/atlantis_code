Files will work as listed in sample use case of assessment paper.
To mantain the privacy, I have added sender_email and sender_pwd to send_email.py
To send an email from gmail account please turn on access to less secure apps,
else mail will not be sent and error will come in console.

NOTE: https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/ is not returning proper results therefore, I have 
attested dictionary_search_alt.py as an alternative, which uses nltk and gives more accurate 
meaning. Testing can be ignored if dictionary_search.py seems fine.
